Hi there 🖐️ 🇧🇷 

I'm a full stack developer with a focus on backend development. I'm passionate about creating innovative tools and technologies that can make a positive impact on the world . In my professional career, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, both for clients and for personal interest. 

In addition to my work as a developer, I also enjoy mentoring junior developers and helping them build their skillset. I believe that sharing knowledge and experience is an important part of being a successful technologist, and I'm always happy to play a mentoring role for others.

I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer, and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experience with others along the way. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat about technology. 💬
